Nice post from Mike Cohn: [How Do You Get from Here to Agile? Iterate. | Mike Cohn's Blog - Succeeding With Agile®](http://blog.mountaingoatsoftware.com/how-do-you-get-from-here-to-agile-iterate).

> Historically, when an organization needed to change, it undertook a “change program.” The change was designed, had an identifiable beginning and ending, and was imposed from above. This worked well in an era when change was necessary only once every few years. But in today’s fast-paced, ever changing environment, it makes more sense to create agile organizations, ready to adapt to whatever comes their way.

Evolution is the answer. The path? SCRUM might be one. In general having a backlog and a small dedicated time to improve is (one of) the key to success. Start know, do, learn ...  and iterate. PierG
