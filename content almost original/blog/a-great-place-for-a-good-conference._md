I attended (too) few sessions at [XP2009](http://www.xp2009.org): smart people (Mary Poppendieck, Ivar Jacobson, David Anderson among others) and great arguments.

It was in a great place too, in Sardinia … look at what was outside the conference rooms.

Great place and … (almost) no wireless, no mobile phone connectivity (as the conference was at floor –1), no power point for laptops.

So .. the definition of ‘great place’ varies a lot if you want to have an holidays conference or a working conference!
